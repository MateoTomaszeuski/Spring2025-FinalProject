## Progress Made
- General styling
- To-Do page
- API works in Azure
  - More detail on endpoints and services(?)
- Database schema
- Auth

## Sticking Points
- Calling async methods in the constructor (solved by using OnAppearing)
- Automated testing for MAUI (separated ViewModel logic into a class library)
- Dapper interpolation - characters not being read properly


## What's Next
- More API endpoints/services to build out functionality
- Mobile-responsive styling (we want it to look good on desktop and mobile)
