#### 1. Multiple Font Family Incompatibility in MAUI Button
**Description** 
  - On the To-Do page, I added the ability to sort a list by category in both directions (both ascending and descending). To make this clear in the UI, I wanted the "Sort by Category" button to also have an icon that dynamically changes from an up/down arrow depending on the direction of the sort. The button's text property only supports one font family, but I'm using FontAwesome for icons and needed to set that accordingly. I didn't know how to include both text (with the default FontFamily) and the icon (with the FontAwesome FontFamily) in the same button element.

**Attempts To Fix:**
  - I thought about trying to overlay elements so they looked like a single element, but this felt like it would be prone to misfunctioning, especially in the mobile version of the app.
  - I realized I could create my own button and try to make it match the default button, but I had to do some research on using GestureRecognizers in the Grid.
 
**Solution:**
  - I basically created my own button from scratch using a border, a grid, and a gesture recognizer. This solution led to a lot of XAML code, but it does look the way I wanted it to.
