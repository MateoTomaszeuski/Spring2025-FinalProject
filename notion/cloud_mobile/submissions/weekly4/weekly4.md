## Blocking Issues
Share 3+ different blocking issues that you were stuck on for a while, and how you resolved them.

#### 1. Multiple Font Family Incompatibility in MAUI Button
**Description** 
  - On the To-Do page, I added the ability to sort a list by category in both directions (both ascending and descending). To make this clear in the UI, I wanted the "Sort by Category" button to also have an icon that dynamically changes from an up/down arrow depending on the direction of the sort. The button's text property only supports one font family, but I'm using FontAwesome for icons and needed to set that accordingly. I didn't know how to include both text (with the default FontFamily) and the icon (with the FontAwesome FontFamily) in the same button element.

**Attempts To Fix:**
  - I thought about trying to overlay elements so they looked like a single element, but this felt like it would be prone to misfunctioning, especially in the mobile version of the app.
  - I realized I could create my own button and try to make it match the default button, but I had to do some research on using GestureRecognizers in the Grid.
 
**Solution:**
  - I basically created my own button from scratch using a border, a grid, and a gesture recognizer. This solution led to a lot of XAML code, but it does look the way I wanted it to.

#### 2. ViewModel Breaks Conditionally Visible Tools
* **Description:** 
  - We're using custom controls to render the individual tools on the tools page. Having ViewModels for each of the tools seems to break the Tools page.
* **Solution:**
  - Workaround: use the code-behind for the tools logic instead of MVVM.

#### 3. Emails can send to the sender, but no one else
* **Description:** 
  - Our EmailService is set up and we've added configuration values for the SMTP server, the email sender details, and the app key password. When sending an email for authentication, an email is not sent to the user.
* **Attempts To Fix:**
  - We verified that the app key was being used to connect to the gmail account.
  - We experimented by trying to send an authentication email to the sending email address itself (consiliumapp2026@gmail.com). This worked, but no other accounts receive emails. 
* **Solution:**
  - It was in the spam folder. We found a few tips to (try to) prevent emails from going to the spam folder. We used html in our email instead of just including a sketchy link.
