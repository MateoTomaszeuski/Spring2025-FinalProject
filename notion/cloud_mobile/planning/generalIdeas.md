# Brain Dump

- multiple lists for each user
- configuring categories in settings


## Optimization
#### To-Dos
- capping to-do items per user (50?)
- deleting old to-do items from database and UI (3 months?)




## Social
#### Shared To-Do Lists
- have an association table to associate groups of users with lists
- To-Do list would need a foreign key to the group ID
