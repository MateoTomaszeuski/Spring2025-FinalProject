## Positive Feedback
- good, user-friendly design
- tasks and subtasks are set up in an intuitive way
- using an expandable drop-down instead of a pop-up for viewing assignment details was the right call
- she loved the idea of including statistics!!

## Negative Feedback
- wants a little more customization, particularly assigning colors to courses and tasks
- definitely wants a pomodoro timer (not implemented yet)

## Feature Suggestions
- Customizability is a big deal -- color coding, in particular
  - color coding task categories, but also setting the colors or general color theme for the whole app (which is something we could do fairly easily, if we just had the extra time)
- in terms of statistics, she'd like to see a stat based on number of assignments completed per month
- setting reminders for assignments (this seems doable!)
