## Positive Feedback
- Timestamps on chats are pretty neat
- Calendar is cool
- Display for chats

## Negative Feedback
- Didn't figure out that Profile was a sign-in AND sign-up page
- Didn't know the checkbox was for completion specifically in TDI

## Feature Suggestions
- Select multiple in TodoItem (maybe not relevant?)
- Click on day for items on that day (probably just Assignments)
- Group chats? 


## Bugfixes
- Not changing sort (TDI) doesn't refresh list if items changed
- Logged in text should be disabled after logging in (just visual annoyance)
- Start button in Assignments broke the program
