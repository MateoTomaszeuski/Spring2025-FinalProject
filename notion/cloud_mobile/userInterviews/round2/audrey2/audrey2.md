# UI
- should dark mode vs light mode be in the settings?
- yes, and it should have an option to "sync to system settings"


## Tabbar: Should it have text?
- the icons pretty clearly indicate what the pages do
- and, all you have to do to find out is click on the page
- so, text isn't necessary on the mobile version

## To-Do
- be consistent with the button (should be "To-Do")
- grey out tasks that are completed (use an AdaptiveTrigger to set opacity to 0.65 based on IsCompleted bool)
- definitely wants color-coding according to category (including the text and the checkbox)

# To-Do
- filter by is important

## Configuring Tasks
- doesn't feel intuitive to hide the ability to edit categories in settings
    - should have a button to configure categories in the to-do page, or at least a note clarifying that the user can set their categories

# Configuration/Customization
- can turn off the "are you sure you want to delete" on the to-do list
- let users choose between countdowns or dates for assignment due dates

# Assignments
- assignment description: dropdown vs popup?
    - unsure, but a popup might be nicer to keep the UI clean and consistent
- say "Add To-Do" instead of "Create To-Do" 

# Tools
- regular timer alongside the pomodoro
- wants to just set the timer and work for that long, instead of being restricted by the pomodoro times

# Dashboard
- quick access to the settings
    - or shortcuts to some of the main settings?
