## Positive Feedback
- Likes the tab menu
- likes the tools being in the app

## Negative Feedback
- the sorting by category was slow they wanted it to be more 
- the sorting functionality also seemed weird to them, like why would we sort by different things.

## Feature Suggestions
- Add in UI boxes for each category when sorting (this might be solvable by filtering)
- Add in a calendar
