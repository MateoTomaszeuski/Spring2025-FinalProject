# Making the Telemetry Pipelines Discord

- Copied from the Discord channel settings
- Saved as a secret in Github 
- Made new workflow
- Broke something (linting in API Program.cs)

- Got our first Discord message working (yay!)
- Spent 30 minutes trying to get the commit message to come with the message
  - What eventually worked was `github.event.head_commit.message`
